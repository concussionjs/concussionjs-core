The ConcussionJS Community's Mission
=====================================

Our mission is to bring down the barriers to creating, and learning how to create, modern applications and drive platform adoption by:

+ Applying a model-driven, rather than code driven, approach
+ Reducing the technical expertise required (e.g., web server, app server, database, web services, JavaScript) to build apps
+ Increasing the power of HTML and CSS skills
+ Ensuring that learnability for first time users is sacred, and that time to learn a task is proportional to its complexity
+ Providing a way for people to interact with the platform at all points along the interest curve (e.g., "I just heard about the platform and am still skeptical" to "I love the technology and want to deploy it behind my firewall" to "I have drunk the kool aid, and now want to contribute to the codebase") that only requires a level of effort proportional to the interest level

Our Platform Roadmap
====================
The platform's initial target usecases are: 
+ Building simple, graphically rich web applications
+ Rapid prototyping (e.g., turning a static HTML prototype into an interactive, database backed application)

As the community grows and platform matures, the goal is to support increasingly sophisticated use cases, and ultimately support both enterprise-ready business applications and web-scale, consumer facing apps.

In addition, we believe that to become a dominant platform ConcussionJS must be able to:
+ Run on-demand and on-premises
+ Operate on-line and off-line
+ Deploy as both a multi-tenant and single-tenant solution
+ Deploy as a self-installable package, a virtual appliance, an AWS image, and even be run without deploying anything at all (e.g., a hosted JavaScript include + freely available backend services)
+ Support apps for native mobile, web mobile, tablet, desktop, and, eventually, TV and larger formats
+ Incrementally scale at all layers of the stack
+ Provide application QA, integrity verification, and remediation
+ Offer built-in analytics, dashboards, and performance management

We are just at the beginning of this journey, and there is much to do to fully realize this vision. If you've been frustrated with the inefficieny of building apps and want to take up arms against the encumbant platforms, please join us on github and contribute. 

Immediate areas we would like your help with include, but are not limited to, the following:

+ Adding support for KnockoutJS alternatives, in particular AngularJS (www.angularjs.org)
+ Integrating better security and identity management
+ Improving admin console's support for data object model and instance management, including searching and displaying large record sets
+ Building examples of ConcussionJS in action
